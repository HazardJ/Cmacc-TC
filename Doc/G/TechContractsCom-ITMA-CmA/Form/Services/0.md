4.sec=Vendor represents and warrants that: (A) the <a href='#Def.Professional_Service.sec' class='definedterm'>Professional Services</a> will be provided in a workmanlike manner and with the highest professional standards and practices; (B) each technology <a href='#Def.Deliverable.sec' class='definedterm'>Deliverable</a> will perform according to its <a href='#Def.Specification.sec' class='definedterm'>Specifications</a> for a period of 1 year following <a href='#Def.Acceptance.sec' class='definedterm'>Acceptance</a>, or for such other period as is set forth in the relevant <a href='#Def.Statement_of_Work.sec' class='definedterm'>Statement of Work</a> <a href='#Def.Addendum.sec' class='definedterm'>Addendum</a>; and (c) Vendor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulation in connection with the performance of the <a href='#Def.Professional_Service.sec' class='definedterm'>Professional Services</a>, including without limitation laws, rules, and regulations governing discrimination in contracting and employment.

6.sec=Vendor shall assign personnel of such skill levels as is necessary to perform <a href='#Def.Professional_Service.sec' class='definedterm'>Professional Services</a>.
