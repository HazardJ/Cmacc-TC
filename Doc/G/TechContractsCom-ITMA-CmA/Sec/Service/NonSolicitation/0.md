Ti=Nonsolicitation

sec=During the term of this <a href="Def.Agreement.sec" class="definedterm">Agreement</a> and for 1 year after termination, Vendor shall not solicit any of <a href='#Def.Customer.sec' class='definedterm'>Customer</a>â€™s employees involved in <a href='#Def.Professional_Service.sec' class='definedterm'>Professional Services</a> to consider alternate employment. For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence does not forbid a solicitation to the general public. For each employee who quits as a result of breach of this Article {NonSolicitation.Xnum}, the soliciting party Vendor shall pay <a href='#Def.Customer.sec' class='definedterm'>Customer</a> {Nonsolicit.QuittingLumpSumDamage.$}, as liquidated damages. The parties agree that the damages set forth in the preceding sentence are liquidated damages and not penalties and that they are reasonable in light of the harm that would be caused by breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience and infeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.
