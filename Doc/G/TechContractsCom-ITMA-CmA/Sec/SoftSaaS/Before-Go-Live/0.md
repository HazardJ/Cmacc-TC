Ti=Timing of Maintenance Fees & SaaS Subscriptions

Note=This is meant to ensure <a href='#Def.Customer.sec' class='definedterm'>Customer</a> doesn't pay for maintenance or <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a> before systems are in use. This is generally unpopular with vendors.

sec=Notwithstanding any provision of an <a href='#Def.Addendum.sec' class='definedterm'>Addendum</a> to the contrary: (A) no fees for maintenance of <a href='#Def.Licensed_Software.sec' class='definedterm'>Licensed Software</a> or <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a>, including without limitation for <a href='#Def.Upgrade.sec' class='definedterm'>Upgrades</a> (as defined in Subsection {ServiceLevel.Software.Upgrade.Xnum} above), will accrue before Go-Live (as defined below); and (B) no period before Go-Live will be counted against the time covered by any maintenance period. Unless the applicable <a href='#Def.Software/SaaS_Addendum.sec' class='definedterm'>Software/SaaS Addendum</a> provides to the contrary, no fees for use of <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a> will accrue before Go-Live, and no period before Go-Live will be counted against the time covered by any <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a> subscription fees. This Article {Before-Go-Live.Xnum} limits the potential periods of maintenance and of <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a> subscriptions and will not be construed to extend or otherwise define such periods. “Go-Live” refers to the earlier of <a href='#Def.Acceptance.sec' class='definedterm'>Acceptance</a> of the <a href='#Def.Licensed_Software.sec' class='definedterm'>Licensed Software</a> or <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a> or <a href='#Def.Customer.sec' class='definedterm'>Customer</a>’s first use of the <a href='#Def.Licensed_Software.sec' class='definedterm'>Licensed Software</a> or <a href='#Def.SaaS.sec' class='definedterm'>SaaS</a> in production, other than a beta use or test.
