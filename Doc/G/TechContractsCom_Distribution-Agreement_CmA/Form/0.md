In the event of an Indemnified Claim, Provider may exercise any of the remedies set forth in Subsections {10.1.2.Xnum}(i) through {10.2.Xnum}(iii) above, including without limitation its right therein to terminate licenses.

Indemnitor will control the defense of any Indemnified Claim, including appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof; provided Indemnified Party will have the right, not to be exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it admit wrongdoing or liability or subjects it to any ongoing affirmative obligations. (As used in this Article {11.Xnum}, a party’s “Associates” are its officers, directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, agents, successors, and assigns.
